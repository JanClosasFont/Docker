<h2>Introduction</h2>
This repository should serve as a guide for me and anyone willing to learn how dockers actually works, a repository which i will keep updating with more advanced stuff, both theorical documentation and practical examples such as containers i create myself.

I created this repository as inspiration from THM (TryHackMe), a web page with a full load of activities and challenges for any technician out there hopping to learn about cybersecurity and more.
